# API for forms

Steps to run this project:

1. Run `npm i` command
2. Setup database settings inside `data-source.ts` file
3. Make sure you have a local postgres user root with the same password. Create one if it doesn't exist
4. Run `npm start` command

P.S. Just for the example I've built 2 entities with different kinds of forms
